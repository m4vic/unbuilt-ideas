# 🚀 Unbuilt Ideas – Neuralchemy Labs

A curated vault of AI ideas that came to mind but haven't been built yet.  
Some are wild. Some are practical. Some may evolve into full SaaS products.  
All of them live here so they don't get lost — and so others can use them too.

If you use any idea from this repo,  
👉 **please credit neuralchemy-labs — thank me later.**

## 📂 What This Repo Is

A public idea library containing:
- Tool ideas  
- SaaS concepts  
- Agent workflows  
- ML/RAG ideas  
- Cyber/OSINT concepts  
- Automation ideas  
- Experimental thoughts  

Each idea has its own `.md` file inside the `/ideas` folder.  
This repo is intentionally simple — a place to store **creativity, not code**.

---

## 🧭 Our Focus

Neuralchemy Labs is building **AI Security, Crypto Intelligence, and Developer Tools**.  
These ideas are great — but outside our current roadmap. Build them yourself!

## 💡 Why These Are Unbuilt

Each idea includes one of these reasons:

- **Outside our focus area** - We're building AI security + crypto tools
- **Requires different expertise** - Hardware, VR, gaming, psychology
- **Capital intensive** - Needs VC funding, manufacturing, enterprise sales
- **Market too early** - Technology not mature yet
- **Better as feature** - Should be part of existing platform, not standalone
- **Crowded market** - Too much competition without clear differentiation

---

## 🛠️ How to Use These Ideas

1. **Pick one that excites you** - Passion matters for execution
2. **Validate the market first** - Talk to 10 potential customers before building
3. **Start with MVP** - Ship something minimal in 4-8 weeks
4. **Credit us** - If you build it, let us know and give attribution
