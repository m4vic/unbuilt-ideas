#🚀 Unbuilt Ideas – Neuralchemy Labs

A curated vault of AI ideas that came to mind but haven’t been built yet.
Some are wild. Some are practical. Some may evolve into full SaaS products.
All of them live here so they don’t get lost — and so others can use them too.

If you use any idea from this repo,
👉 please credit neuralchemy-labs — thank me later.


📂 What This Repo Is

A public idea library containing:

- tool ideas
- SaaS concepts
- agent workflows
- ML/RAG ideas
- cyber/OSINT concepts
- automation ideas
- experimental thoughts
Each idea has its own .md file inside the /ideas folder.

This repo is intentionally simple — a place to store creativity, not code.
