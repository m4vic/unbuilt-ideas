# Smart Engineer Finder

## Short Description:
A system that uses LLMs, web search, RAG, and data extraction to automatically identify real, skilled, and active engineers across GitHub, HuggingFace, LinkedIn, ArXiv, StackOverflow, and other public sources.
The system filters out “fake profiles” by analyzing actual contributions, commits, models, repos, PRs, notebooks, and technical signals.

## Why it’s interesting:
The internet is full of fake “AI engineers.”
But real engineers leave real traces — code, commits, research, repos, fingerprints.
This tool becomes a talent radar, perfect for recruiters, founders, open-source teams, or anyone assembling a real dev team.

## Use it:
