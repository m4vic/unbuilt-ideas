# Team Decision Facilitator

## 💡 Concept
AI that analyzes team decisions, predicts outcomes of different choices, and highlights trade-offs to guide group decision-making. Think "AI strategic advisor for managers."

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Team inputs decision context: problem, options, constraints, goals
2. AI analyzes historical data, similar decisions, team dynamics
3. Generates outcome predictions for each option (risk, cost, time, impact)
4. Highlights trade-offs and blind spots the team might miss
5. Facilitates discussion with structured frameworks (SWOT, cost-benefit)
6. Tracks decision outcomes over time to improve predictions

## 💰 Revenue Model
- Team tier ($99/mo): Up to 10 users
- Business ($299/mo): Up to 50 users, advanced analytics
- Enterprise ($999+/mo): Unlimited users, custom models, integrations
- Per-seat pricing alternative: $20/user/month

## 🚧 Why Unbuilt
**Requires enterprise sales expertise we don't have:**
- Decision-makers (VPs, executives) buy this, not engineers
- Need case studies and ROI proof (6-12 month sales cycle)
- Hard to position: Analytics? Collaboration? Project management?
- No company will trust AI for important decisions yet
- Better as feature for Asana/Monday.com than standalone

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + collaborative whiteboard (Miro-style)
- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- AI: GPT-4 for analysis + decision frameworks
- Analytics: Data visualization (D3.js, Recharts)
- Integrations: Slack, Teams, Jira, Confluence

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Difficult to prove value before long-term use
- Outcomes take weeks/months to validate predictions
- Executives skeptical of "AI telling them what to do"
- Requires understanding of organizational psychology
- High churn if predictions are often wrong

## 🎯 Best For
Founders with enterprise B2B sales experience, organizational psychology background, existing relationships with C-suite, or experience building collaboration tools like Miro/Figma.
