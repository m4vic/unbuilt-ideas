# NeuraVault

## 💡 Concept
AI-powered "second brain" that indexes everything you consume (articles, videos, docs, conversations) and builds a queryable personal knowledge graph. Chat with your accumulated knowledge.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. Browser extension auto-saves articles, videos, tweets you read
2. AI processes and connects information into knowledge graph
3. Chat interface: "What was that article about RAG I read last week?"
4. AI retrieves context + summarizes + links related concepts
5. Automatic tagging, categorization, and insight generation

## 💰 Revenue Model
- Free: 100 items/month, basic search
- Premium ($9.99/mo): Unlimited items, AI chat, advanced search
- Pro ($19.99/mo): API access, team sharing, export features
- Enterprise: Company knowledge retention ($499+/mo)

## 🚧 Why Unbuilt
Notion, Obsidian, and Mem.ai already dominate this space. Consumer apps need viral distribution. Better as a feature in existing tools than standalone product. We're focusing on B2B security instead.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Chrome Extension
- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Pinecone (vector DB)
- AI: OpenAI embeddings + GPT-4 for retrieval
- Storage: S3 for media files

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Competing with free alternatives (Notion, Obsidian)
- Consumer willingness to pay is low
- Data privacy concerns (storing all browsing history)
- Need 10K+ users to reach $5K MRR

## 🎯 Best For
PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) enthusiasts, note-taking founders, or as B2B pivot for "institutional knowledge retention" in companies.
