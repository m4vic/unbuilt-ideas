# PersonaRank

## 💡 Concept
AI-powered personality ranking system that turns your online presence into a Solo Leveling-style RPG character (Level, Rank, Stats, Class) with gamified self-improvement quests.

## 🎯 How It Works
1. User connects social media (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn)
2. AI analyzes personality + behavior patterns
3. Generates RPG character sheet with stats (Intelligence, Creativity, Discipline, etc.)
4. Provides daily/weekly quests to improve stats and level up
5. Track progress with achievements and badges

## 💰 Revenue Model
- Free: Basic profile + daily quests
- Premium ($9/mo): Deep insights, AI mentor, unlimited quests
- B2B ($199/mo): TeamRank for companies (hiring, team building)

## 🚧 Why Unbuilt
Consumer apps need viral growth and 10K+ users for revenue. We're focused on B2B security tools instead. Better suited for founders with gaming/psychology background.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js + React
- Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 for analysis
- Social: Twitter/LinkedIn/GitHub APIs

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Viral growth is unpredictable
- Consumer monetization is hard (2-5% conversion typical)
- Retention issues (most abandon within 30 days)
- Privacy concerns with social media scraping

## 🎯 Best For
Founders with consumer app experience, growth marketing skills, and understanding of gamification psychology.
